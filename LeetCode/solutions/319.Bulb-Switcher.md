### Questions

There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the i-th round, you toggle every i bulb. For the n-th round, you only toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.

**Example:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 

So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.
```

### Solutions

分析问题，我们可以知道当且仅当一盏灯在其乘数轮才会被切换开关。

例如：6 = 1 * 6 = 2 * 3，所以会被切换四轮，最终还是关的。

问题中需要我们计算最后是on状态的灯泡有多少个，实际上就是计算乘数为奇数的数有多少个。

乘数为奇数，即该数包含2n个不同数的积和1个相同数的积，例如 16 = 1 * 16 = 2 * 8 = 4 * 4，最后16位置的灯始终开启。

所以只需要计算n的开方值即可。

``` python
class Solution(object):
    def bulbSwitch(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        return int(pow(n, 0.5))
