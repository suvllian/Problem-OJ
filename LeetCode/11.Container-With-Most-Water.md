### Questions
Descrition: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note**: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
### Solutions

### Answers

``` python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        maxarea = 0
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1

        while(left < right):
            maxarea = max(maxarea, min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left))

            if (height[left] < height[right]):
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return maxarea

solution = Solution()
print solution.maxArea([1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7])
